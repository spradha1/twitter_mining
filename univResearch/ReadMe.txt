Completed task on 11.02.2017 and presented on InnovateUNO, a research presentations event at The University of New Orleans.

This research task was performed to analyse all the tweets gathered between 08.27.2017 to 08.31.2017, which were directed towards 19 campuses in Louisiana. The goal was to observe what kind of patterns and level of sentiment is seen in the tweets during the time of Hurricane Harvey. Major conclusions that were got was that colleges that notified their students about school operations later than others had more negative tweets directed towards them. Also, with time, the tweets become more positive as the storm settles and everything gets back to normal.
   
Files SVMharveyBinary.py, SVMharveySingleStep.py, harveyNaive.py and MaxEharvey.py correspond to the classifiers their names represent. The catLabel files contain the categorization lists for the 3656 tweets used in this task. 'h', 'e' and 'i' refer to Harvey, School-related and irrelevant tweets. Similarly, 'r' and 'i' refer to relevant and irrelevant tweets.

univdata.txt is the raw file with the streamed tweets. tweetsUniv.txt and sampleharvey.txt are the ones with only the textual information of the tweets used as entire data and training data respectively.
